### Checklist — evaluate every item

**Provider isolation**
- [ ] No `pg`, `supabase-js`, or `neon` import outside `src/lib/db/`
- [ ] No raw Supabase client call inside a React page or component
- [ ] All DB access goes through `queryForOrg()`

**Multi-tenancy**
- [ ] Every query is scoped to `org_id` — never unscoped selects
- [ ] `org_id` comes from `user.org_id` in session — never from request body

**Auth & security**
- [ ] Every server action (`'use server'`) has auth check as its FIRST statement
- [ ] Every API route handler checks auth before any DB call

**Validation**
- [ ] Every form uses `zodResolver` — no manual `if (!email)` guards
- [ ] Every server action calls `schema.safeParse()` before any DB mutation

**No duplication**
- [ ] No component re-created that already exists in `src/components/shared/`
- [ ] No duplicate Zod schema for an entity already in `lib/validations/`

**Tests**
- [ ] Unit tests exist for new server actions and Zod schemas
- [ ] Tests cover: valid input ✓ | invalid input ✓ | auth guard ✓ | success ✓ | DB error ✓
- [ ] E2E test exists for any new user-facing page or flow
