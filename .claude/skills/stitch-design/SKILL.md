## How to fetch a screen before building

Before writing any UI code, call the Stitch MCP to get the screen:

```
Use the stitch MCP tool get_screen with:
  project_id: "10851584638320860726"
  screen_id: "<screen id from table above>"
```

Then implement the UI to match — layout, spacing, colors, component names.

## Design System (always fetch first for any new component)

Always fetch the Design System screen before building new shared components.
It defines: color tokens, typography scale, spacing, button variants, badge styles.

## Rules

- Always fetch the relevant Stitch screen before writing a page or component
- Match layout exactly — don't approximate
- Color: Indigo `#4F46E5` primary, `gray-50` background, white surfaces
- Font: Inter (all weights via Tailwind `font-sans`)
- Component names in code must match Stitch: `DataTable`, `KanbanCard`, `StatusBadge`, `ActivityTimeline`
- If a screen exists in Stitch for this feature — use it. Never design from scratch.
- For Auth pages (no Stitch screen): use shadcn Card, centered layout, `max-w-md mx-auto mt-24`

## Screen → Module Mapping

| Module | Stitch Screen to fetch |
|--------|----------------------|
| Layout shell | CRM Sales Dashboard (sidebar + topbar reference) |
| Shared components | Design System |
| Contacts | CRM Contacts List + CRM Contact Detail |
| Leads | CRM Leads List & Detail |
| Deals | CRM Deals Pipeline |
| Tickets | CRM Support Tickets |
| Dashboard | CRM Sales Dashboard |
| Reports | CRM Reports Dashboard |
| Auth | No Stitch screen — use shadcn Card, `max-w-md mx-auto mt-24` |
| Activities | CRM Contact Detail (timeline section) |
| Settings | No Stitch screen — follow design system tokens |
