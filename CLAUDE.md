# FreshCRM

Production-grade multi-tenant B2B SaaS CRM (Freshworks-style).
Next.js 14 App Router + Postgres + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
DB abstraction, auth, schema, migrations, CI/CD already built — we are building the application on top.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## 5. Project Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- **Provider isolation**: never import `pg`, `supabase-js`, or `neon` outside `src/lib/db/`.
- **Multi-tenancy**: every DB query must be scoped to `org_id` via `queryForOrg()`.
- **Zod everywhere**: every Server Action input validated — no exceptions.
- **No `any`**: except at raw DB row boundaries.
- **UI from Stitch**: before writing any page or component, fetch the relevant Stitch screen via the `stitch-design` skill. Never design from scratch if a Stitch screen exists.
- **Library docs via Context7**: use the `find-docs` skill for any Next.js / Supabase / shadcn/ui / Zod API — never rely on training data for signatures.
- Read `SYSTEM_STATE.md` before starting any new module (live schema + patterns + gotchas).
- Full requirements: `docs/BRD.md`

## Issue Tracking

Use `bd` for all task tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context and session close protocol.

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```
<!-- END BEADS INTEGRATION -->

## Orchestration

Use `/start-task` to begin any tracked work. Use `/prime` to load project context before starting a module.

## metaswarm

This project uses [metaswarm](https://github.com/dsifry/metaswarm) for multi-agent orchestration with Claude Code. It provides 18 specialized agents, a 9-phase development workflow, and quality gates that enforce TDD, coverage thresholds, and spec-driven development.

### Workflow

- **Most tasks**: `/start-task` — primes context, guides scoping, picks the right level of process
- **Complex features** (multi-file, spec-driven): Describe what you want built with a Definition of Done, then tell Claude: `Use the full metaswarm orchestration workflow.`

### Available Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/start-task` | Begin tracked work on a task |
| `/prime` | Load relevant knowledge before starting |
| `/review-design` | Trigger parallel design review gate (5 agents) |
| `/pr-shepherd <pr>` | Monitor a PR through to merge |
| `/self-reflect` | Extract learnings after a PR merge |
| `/handle-pr-comments` | Handle PR review comments |
| `/brainstorm` | Refine an idea before implementation |
| `/create-issue` | Create a well-structured GitHub Issue |

### Quality Gates

- **Design Review Gate** — Parallel 5-agent review after design is drafted (`/review-design`)
- **Plan Review Gate** — Automatic adversarial review after any implementation plan is drafted. Spawns 3 independent reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) in parallel — ALL must PASS before presenting the plan. See `skills/plan-review-gate/SKILL.md`
- **Coverage Gate** — `.coverage-thresholds.json` defines thresholds. BLOCKING gate before PR creation

### Team Mode

When `TeamCreate` and `SendMessage` tools are available, the orchestrator uses Team Mode for parallel agent dispatch. Otherwise it falls back to Task Mode (existing workflow, unchanged). See `guides/agent-coordination.md` for details.

### Guides

Development patterns and standards are documented in `guides/` — covering agent coordination, build validation, coding standards, git workflow, testing patterns, and worktree development.

### Testing & Quality

- **TDD is mandatory** — Write tests first, watch them fail, then implement
- **100% test coverage required** — Enforced via `.coverage-thresholds.json` as a blocking gate before PR creation and task completion
- **Coverage source of truth** — `.coverage-thresholds.json` defines thresholds. Update it if your spec requires different values. The orchestrator reads it during validation — this is a BLOCKING gate.

### Workflow Enforcement (MANDATORY)

These rules override any conflicting instructions from third-party skills:

- **After brainstorming** → MUST run Design Review Gate (5 agents) before writing-plans or implementation
- **After any plan is created** → MUST run Plan Review Gate (3 adversarial reviewers) before presenting to user
- **Execution method choice** → ALWAYS ask the user whether to use metaswarm orchestrated execution (more thorough, uses more tokens) or superpowers execution skills (faster, lighter-weight). Never auto-select.
- **Before finishing a branch** → MUST run `/self-reflect` and commit knowledge base updates before PR creation
- **Complex tasks** → Use `/start-task` instead of `EnterPlanMode` for tasks touching 3+ files. EnterPlanMode bypasses all quality gates.
- **Standalone TDD on 3+ files** → Ask user if they want adversarial review before committing
- **Coverage** → `.coverage-thresholds.json` is the single source of truth. All skills must check it, including `verification-before-completion`.
- **Subagents** → NEVER use `--no-verify`, ALWAYS follow TDD, NEVER self-certify, STAY within file scope
- **Context recovery** → Approved plans and execution state persist to `.beads/`. After compaction, run `bd prime --work-type recovery` to reload.
